## Version 1 (27/6/2020)
<i>creator's confession</i><br/>
Musics have always existed around humanlives for many decades before. Summer 2020, as a hobbyist, I decided to create this simple music led for fun and party.
My prior knowledge of arduino stuffs are derived from the first course in embedded systems which I learnt in spring 2020. The project ideas began in April 2020 
however, things were delayed more than a month because of online shipment. Fortunately, it can be still continued.<br/>

As an amateur in Electronics, I welcome any contributions or criticism about my work if there are errors and misunderstandings

<li>Arduino UNO</li>
